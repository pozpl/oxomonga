{"name":"Where are kittens","tagline":"Geohashing framework on Perl and AngularJS ","body":"where_are_kittens\r\n=================\r\n\r\nWhere Are Kittens is a boilerplate for Perl, MongoDB and AngularJS projects with example of geohashing functionality.\r\n\r\nThis code can be useful as a start for modern web applications with a stack of auxiliary technologies and frameworks to\r\nspeed up development.\r\nOut of the the box it provides integration of libraries in core functionality along with a useful programming\r\nmodel that can be utilized to build robust and extensible products.\r\nAs an example the project contained API for geohashing markers manipulation and simple AngularJS frontend, that can be styled for\r\ndifferent kinds of specialized applications.\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGIES\r\n------------\r\n* Backend language - Perl\r\n* Database - MongoDb\r\n* Web frontend - AngularJS, Bootstrap\r\n\r\nThe backend part is based on [OX](https://github.com/iinteractive/OX)  web framework. The main features of this framework is\r\nusage of Dependency Injection pattern and PSGI support. Due to DI paradigm we can achieve decoupling of components and\r\ngood modularity. PSGI make this framework compatible with modern perl web techniques and technologies including wide\r\nvariety of application servers such as starman and twiggy.\r\n\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\n-------------\r\nIn order to run backend part you need perl >= 5.10 installed, and mongodb.\r\nTo run and develop frontend you need node and yeoman.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n------------\r\nGo to the project directory\r\n*cd project_folder*\r\n\r\nInstall dependencies via cpanm\r\n\r\n*cpanm --installdeps .*\r\n\r\nIf you want to use JS frontend,  you have to populate dependencies in  resources/static/js\r\nwith help of bower tool.\r\n\r\n*cd resources/static/js*\r\n\r\n*bower install*\r\n\r\nWhen all dependencies are installed application can be run with this command from project directory\r\n\r\n*perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5/ -I lib/ ~/perl5/bin/plackup -R ./lib/ -R scripts/  scripts/app_dev.psgi*\r\n\r\nThis run command assumes that all your dependencies are installed by non root user via cpanm + liblocal\r\nIt will appear on address *http://127.0.0.1:5000/js/app/index.html*\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n--------\r\nApache License Version 2.0","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
